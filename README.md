# Light CDI Web Stack

A POC to evaluate a stack for web applications around:
- [Weld](https://weld.cdi-spec.org/) for the dependency injection
- [Undertow](https://undertow.io/) for the HTTP server
- [JDBI](https://jdbi.org/) for the database access
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for the metrics

Basic AOP transaction management is supported.
